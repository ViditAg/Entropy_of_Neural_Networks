# Robust entropy requires strong and balanced excitatory and inhibitory synapses

This project was done as part of PhD thesis under the guidance of Dr. Woodrow L. Shew at University of Arkansas-Fayetteville. 
It was a computational project where we simulated neural network models of integrate-and-fire neurons with excitatory and inhibitory 
connections known as synapse. We estimated the shannon entropy of the network for a range of network parameters. These parameters namely,
fraction of inhibitory neurons, excitatory synaptic weights and inhibitory synaptic weights. 

Our main result from this work is that the entropy maximizes at regime which is neither excitation-dominant nor inhibition-dominant but
at the boundary of both. Along this boundary we see there is a trade-off between high and robust entropy.  Weak synapse strengths yield
entropy which is high but drops rapidly under parameter change. Strong synapse strengths, on the other hand yield a lower,but more robust,
network entropy.

For detailed description please read the nmanuscript that I have also put in this repository.
